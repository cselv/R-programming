Load Libraries and data set

```{r}
install.packages('factoextra')
library(factoextra)
library(cluster)
df <- USArrests
```

remove rows with missing values
scale each variable to have a mean of 0 and sd of 1
```{r}
df <- na.omit(df)
df <- scale(df)
```

Find the Optimal Number of Clusters

First, weâ€™ll use the fviz_nbclust() function to create a plot of the number of clusters vs. the total within sum of squares:

```{r}
fviz_nbclust(df, kmeans, method = "wss")

```

Perform K-Means Clustering with Optimal K=4 and 25 different configurations

```{r}
set.seed(1)
km <- kmeans(df, centers = 4, nstart = 25)
km
fviz_cluster(km, data = df)
```
