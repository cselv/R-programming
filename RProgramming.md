# R Programming Class
  
  
## Day One:

### Preliminaries:

##### Introductions
* Your area of expertise
* Your current job tasking
* Your amount of experience with programming and R 
* Expectations for the class
  
##### Course Materials
* Several online books will be referenced
  * Hands-On Programming with R: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/
  * https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/
* Other materials are available at:
  * https://github.com/ExgnosisClasses/R-Programming
  * These will be added to during the class
  * The repo will be available for 30 days after the last session


##### Virtual Machines
* These will be assigned shortly
  * A Protech instruction sheet is in the repo for reference
* You will have the same virtual machine for every class
  * Any time you log on, you can just carry on from where you were previously as long as you saved your work
* Because the class is spread out:
  * The machines may or may not be available outside
of class hours â€“ the physical resources may be needed for
other classes
  * However, the image you were using will be saved and restored
for each class

##### R Studio
* R has a intimidating learning curve
* R Studio is an R development environment that makes learning and using R a LOT more user friendly
* Everything we do in R Studio in class can also be done at the R command line prompt
  
##### Downloading R and R Studio
* Free to use
  * Current R release is "Lost Library Book"
  * Previous Version is "Bunny-Wunnies Freak Out"  (seriously)
  * Available at: https://cran.r-project.org/
* R Studio is available at: https://rstudio.com/

## Intro to R
* Open source collaborative project
* Supported by CRAN - the comprehensive R archive network
* Core R is written in C and Fortran for speed
  * Parts of R are written in R
* It's worth the time to look at the resources available at CRAN
* R is primarily for data analytics / python is ML and Matlab modeling

## R Sessions and R Environment
Main points for this session
* The R session
* Saving and Restoring R session
* Navigating around the file system
* Getting online help
* Creating and removing objects
* Understanding the concept of an object
* Atomic data types
* Arithmetic and relational operators
  
---
## Atomic Vectors
* Creating and building vectors
* Generating sequences
* Operations between vectors
* Missing values
* Implicit type conversions
* Basic functions on vectors

---

creating a vector of different types
experiment with NA
basic arithmetic operations
use some byyasic attributes

# Day Two:
* vectors and arrays
* Projects 
* Packages
* programming in R
* dataframes 
* lists

1. data - measurements - vectors
2. information - organize - data frames
3. knowledge - gain insights
4.  Wisdom - being able to apply knoweldge

arrays are the primitive
